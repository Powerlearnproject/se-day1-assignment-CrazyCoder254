#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software like websites, android applications and games. 
It's importance in the technology industry includes;
Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – NATO Conference on Software Engineering
The term software engineering was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering. This event highlighted the "software crisis," where software development was failing to meet expectations in terms of reliability, cost, and efficiency. The conference established software engineering as a distinct discipline that required systematic methodologies, structured programming, and rigorous development processes.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s–1990s)
The emergence of object-oriented programming (OOP), popularized by languages like C++ and Java, marked a significant shift in software development. OOP introduced key concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software more modular, reusable, and maintainable. This approach revolutionized software design and development, leading to more scalable and efficient systems.

The Agile Manifesto and the Agile Revolution
The Agile Manifesto was published in 2001 by a group of software developers who sought to improve traditional software development methodologies. Agile emphasized iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility over rigid planning. This milestone led to the widespread adoption of Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, which continue to shape modern software engineering practices by promoting adaptability and continuous delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – Defines the project's scope, objectives, feasibility, risks, and resources required. It sets the foundation for the entire development process.

Requirement Analysis – Involves gathering and analyzing user and business needs to create a detailed requirement document that guides development.

Design – Translates requirements into a blueprint, including system architecture, data models, and user interface designs.

Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications, following best practices and coding standards.

Testing – Verifies the software’s functionality, performance, and security through unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.

Deployment – Releases the software for use, either in a live production environment or as a beta version for further evaluation.

Maintenance – Involves fixing bugs, updating features, and optimizing performance based on user feedback and evolving business needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and refining input queries (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models, such as ChatGPT, to obtain accurate, relevant, and useful responses. It involves structuring prompts in a way that maximizes the AI's ability to understand the user's intent and generate high-quality output.

Importance of Prompt Engineering
Enhances AI Output Quality
Well-designed prompts guide AI models to generate more precise, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses. Poorly structured prompts may lead to vague, misleading, or irrelevant answers.

Optimizes Efficiency and Accuracy
By using clear and specific prompts, users can minimize back-and-forth interactions, reducing the time and effort needed to refine responses.

Expands AI Capabilities
Prompt engineering allows users to leverage AI for various tasks, such as content creation, coding assistance, data analysis, and more. A well-crafted prompt can enable AI to generate creative and structured outputs tailored to specific needs.

Reduces Ambiguity and Bias
Thoughtfully designed prompts help mitigate biases in AI responses and ensure that outputs align with ethical and professional standards.

Enhances User Experience
A strategic approach to prompting improves user satisfaction by ensuring that AI interactions are intuitive, informative, and engaging.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Write about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Write a 500-word article explaining how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, including examples of AI applications in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Specificity – Instead of just "technology," the improved prompt narrows the focus to artificial intelligence in healthcare.
Clarity – It clearly states what aspects to cover: diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient care.
Conciseness – The prompt is direct and structured, ensuring the response stays relevant.
Measurable Output – It specifies the word count, helping the writer gauge the length of their response.
This makes it easier for the writer to meet expectations and ensures the output is useful and targeted.
